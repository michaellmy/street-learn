    <hr>
    <p>In this training, you will learn the principles of statistics and analysis and the ways it can be applied in the real world. Little background in mathematics is required. If StreetBot has recommended this to you, it has used its algorithms to analyse your background and found these learning materials suited for you.

		<p>Statistics include numerical facts and figures. For instance:<br><br>
• The largest earthquake measured 9.2 on the Richter scale.<br>
• Men are at least 10 times more likely than women to commit murder.<br>
• One in every 8 South Africans is HIV positive.<br><br>
The study of statistics involves math and relies upon calculations of numbers. But
it also relies heavily on how the numbers are chosen and how the statistics are
interpreted. For example, consider the following three scenarios and the
interpretations based upon the presented statistics. You will find that the numbers
may be right, but the interpretation may be wrong. Try to identify a major flaw
with each interpretation before we describe it.</p><p>If an experiment compares an experimental treatment with a control treatment,
then the independent variable (type of treatment) has two levels: experimental and
control. If an experiment were comparing five types of diets, then the independent
variable (type of diet) would have 5 levels. In general, the number of levels of an
independent variable is the number of experimental conditions.</p><br>

      <p>Often it is necessary to transform data from one measurement scale to another. For
example, you might want to convert height measured in feet to height measured in
inches. Table 1 shows the heights of four people measured in both feet and inches.
To transform feet to inches, you simply multiply by 12. Similarly, to transform
inches to feet, you divide by 12.</p>
		<p>Often we need to compare the results of different surveys, or of different
conditions within the same overall survey. In this case, we are comparing the
“distributions” of responses between the surveys or conditions. Bar charts are often
excellent for illustrating differences between two distributions. Figure 3 shows the
number of people playing card games at the Yahoo web site on a Sunday and on a
Wednesday in the spring of 2001. We see that there were more players overall on
Wednesday compared to Sunday. The number of people playing Pinochle was
nonetheless the same on these two days. In contrast, there were about twice as
many people playing hearts on Wednesday as on Sunday. Facts like these emerge
clearly from a well-designed bar chart.</p>
		<h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Summary of Chapter</h2>
		<p style="color: #454545">Pie charts and bar charts can both be effective methods of portraying qualitative
data. Bar charts are better when there are more than just a few categories and for
comparing two or more distributions. Be careful to avoid creating misleading
graphs.</p>
